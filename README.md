# Google_foobar_solutions

My solutions to the algorithmic coding challenges completed for Google's foo.bar recruiting process. Google users are apparently invited to complete these problems if they search some combination of targeted search terms. I was was challenged after searching the phrase "goto statements considered harmful." I completed these problems over two weeks, then was contacted by a recruiter and eventually brought into the Mountainview campus for a software engineering interview. 

In these implementations, for convenience and testing, input arguments are entered into the main functions, or in some cases entered in the console after the user is prompted for them. Results, and in some cases runtimes, are printed to the console. When submitting solutions in the foo.bar interface, arguments and outputs are passed to and returned by the main function. 

These solutions are in Java (Python solutions were also accepted). Only standard libraries were permitted, and solutions were tested for scalability/runtime.
