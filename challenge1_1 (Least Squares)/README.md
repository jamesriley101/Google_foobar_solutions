# Least Squares

A simple algorithm to compute the least number of
squares (result of multiplying an integer by itself,
i.e., 1, 4, 9, ..etc.) that sum to a given integer.

The user is prompted to enter a number.

The minimum number of squares needed to sum to the
number entered by the user is returned, along with an
example of this many squares summing to the target.

	Examples:
	
	Enter a number: 30	//User input
	25 + 4 + 1 = 30		//Program output
	Least Squares: 3	//Program output
	
	Enter a number: 1000001
	1000000 + 1 = 1000001
	Least Squares: 2
	
	Enter a number: 234587
	187489 + 47089 + 9 = 234587
	Least Squares: 3
